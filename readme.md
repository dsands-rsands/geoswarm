## Geoswarm

GeoSwarm enables remote distributed teams from anywhere in the world to collaborate with other individuals, communicate ideas, and understand considerations to solve problems with a low barrier of required technical knowledge

## Using the app

Please downlaod the html file and open in any web browser.

## Inspiration

Before COVID-19, teams would gather in conference rooms, project a map, and then discuss and consider solutions. Sharing your screen to view a map enables visualization, but real-time collaboration is limited and the experience is not great.  

## How we built it

GeoSwarm was built using private hosted feature layers for the tracking of users location and editing functionality as well as basemaps. The application was built on the ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.22 and the Calcite Design System.
